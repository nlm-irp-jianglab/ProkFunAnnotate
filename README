    script provided in download.sh 
    snakemake script needs to be run with --use-singularity command line option
    snakemake script also needs a configuration option provided through the --config 
        command line argument. this configuration option should be in the format of
        "data_dir={dir_path}" with {dir_path} being a path to the output directory.
