Download data used for eggnog_mapper and kofamscan: 

download_snakemake: snakemake script to download data used for eggnog_mapper and kofamscan
usage: 
    script provided in download.sh 
    snakemake script needs to be run with --use-singularity command line option
    snakemake script also needs a configuration option provided through the --config 
        command line argument. this configuration option should be in the format of
        "data_dir={dir_path}" with {dir_path} being a path to the output directory. 
    the script will make a directory specified through the data_dir option, and 
        produce an egg_data and kofam_data directory within this data directory. 
        these directories will be used by the PFA snakemake script to provide 
        access to the data needed by the annotation programs. 


annotate_snakemake: snakemake script to run the PFA annotation pipeline for list of genomes.
usage: 
    script provided in run_pfa.sh
    snakemake script needs to br run with --use-singularity option
    snakemake script needs a configuration file. example in config.yaml file. 
    snakemake script also needs to have the data files downloaded in by the download_snakemake
        script to be bound to the singularity image using the --singularity-args option
        to specify the directories like this:
	     "\-B ./data/egg_data/:/opt/egg_data/,./data/kofam_data:/opt/kofam_data/"
        the data directories should be mounted to /opt/egg_data/ and /opt/kofam_data/


Quickstart:
1. Set up data output directory in download.sh script and launch download job. 
2. get list of genome fasta files (expecting them to be named *.fna) and prepare genome input list.
File should be a single column list of paths to genome files. Genome files should not have their 
suffixes in this file. 
3. setup configuration file. set output directory, path to tmp directory, number of CPUS per subjob, 
and path to the genome input list. 
4. setup paths in run_pfa.sh script, set CPUs, and time appropriately. set paths for binding of
data directory and set path to config in snakemake command. 
5. launch run_pfa.sh. will produce a directory with one subdirectory per genome containing the annotation information.
